Mr. Marquez received a mysterious zip file sent by a close friend via email. The person discloses the zip file contains an important message that he should read immediately.
However, Mr. Marquez could not open the zip file since the gate-keeper (the password) stopped him from entering. 
The communication was disconnected when his friend tries to reveal the password.
Mr. Marquez quickly jogged down some hints during the conversation:
	The gate-keeper made from binary numbers
	His HP (health point) only have 4 points

Now its up to Mr. Marquez to crack this file because perhaps there is another person who cut their conversation, tries to read this secret message!!
Mr. Marquez wanted you to help him crack this zip file with all of the hints that he got.

MISSION: 
	Crack the zip file before the hacker!!
